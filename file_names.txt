File Names

	How files and all other filesystem objects should be named. This also applies
	to directories, symlinks and all other filesystem objects.


Basename

	Lower case with underscores for spaces. This makes things a little easier to
	navigate in the terminal.


File Extension

	Be consisten when reasonable. Try to use the same extension for the same file
	type. This is not always reasonable, for example when working with multiple
	programs with different defaults.
